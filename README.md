## Math Game Description

The Math Game starts immediately with 5 multiple-choice questions focused on mathematics. To win, players need to score at least 3 out of 5. If a player loses, they can learn from their mistakes and try again. This game offers a fun and engaging way to improve math skills while challenging players to achieve a better score with each attempt.

I chose this game because math is a fundamental skill that impacts various aspects of life, from everyday problem-solving to advanced academic pursuits
